# Lua KD-Tree
simple and efficient KD tree and nearest neighbour search in lua

K is fixed to 2. It is more of a 2D-Tree, but can be easily expanded to K dimensions. This example is left at 2 dimesions, as that is sufficient for its inteded usecase

The code includes a KD tree constructor and a nearest neighbour search function, as well as an example usecase

Most of the research as well as the logic behind the nearest neighbour search comes from the YouTube channel "Stable Sort" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glp7THUpGow
